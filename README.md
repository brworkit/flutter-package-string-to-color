## Description
Flutter package to convert color names to Color in Flutter.

Offers a handful way to declare colors using their names instead of using Colors constants.
It is specialy useful when you need to place color in a component comming from server. 
You don't need to build any **from-to** structure to support it, you just need to use like **"green".color()** and the 
magic happens. 

All Flutter **Colors** constants supported.
